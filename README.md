# Death-Calculator

Hola!

this is a fun school math/physics project that I actually made with my friends years ago (I forgot to push it to github). It's a web based calculator that determines the time of death of a person according to the room's and body's temperature. We use "Newton Cooling Law" for the base of the formula.

For this program to work, you first need to install flask.

`python3 -m pip install flask`

and 

`python3 -m flask run`

to run the program.
